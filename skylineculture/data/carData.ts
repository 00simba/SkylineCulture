        description: "A stunning White R34 GT-R V-SPEC, another exclusive variation of the R34. With a production count of just 1,222 units, this car remains a sought-after gem among enthusiasts.\n\nThis car goes above and beyond a stock example, with every detail meticulously fine-tuned to create a true machine for the road.

Upgrades include the HKS 2.8 litre engine, paired with an HKS Big Single Turbo Kit and a very nice and clean engine bay with valve covers in the color of HKS. (Original HKS crate engine) The vehicle has been tested on a dynamometer, where it achieved a remarkable output of 780 horsepower.\n\nIn summary: A rare limited edition R34 GT-R that has been professionally tuned to perfect standards is a perfect addition to any car collector’s collection.
